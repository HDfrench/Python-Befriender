
       Welcome to The Befriender

In this game, you will explore a house, trying to make as many friends as possible.
In each room, you will meet characters, that can be friendly or hostile.

Friends can give you secret objects to convert hostiles into friends, but they will not tell you which object when, although you have to pay attention to what they say!

When meeting hostiles, you must fight them. For each fight, you will pick an item from your inventory that will convert, subdue or kill your opponent, or do nothing!
If you convert your opponent into a friend, the fight is over, you have won and you can 
explore the room.
If you subdue your opponent, you can search the room, but next time you will visit this
room, your enemy will be there ready to fight!
If you kill your enemy, you will never meet this character again in the game.

When you use a gift, it is taken out of your inventory and you won't be able to find or
acquire it again!
If you use the wrong item in a fight, you will lose a third of your health. 
Be careful, you only have 3 lives!
So, you can always run away and go back to a room you already explored. :-)

You cannot go into an unexplored room unless you have defeated or subdued any hostile in your current room.

Rooms also contain furniture that you can explore and maybe find weapons to use against hostiles.

Good luck!
